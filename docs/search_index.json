[["index.html", "Data Analysis: Confidence Intervals and Model Parameter Selection Introduction", " Data Analysis: Confidence Intervals and Model Parameter Selection Introduction In previous weeks we have seen many examples of calculating sample statistics such as means, percentiles, standard deviations and regression coefficients. These sample statistics are used as point estimates of population parameters which describe the population from which the sample of data was taken. That last sentence assumes you're familiar with concepts and terminology about sampling (e.g. from the Statistical Inference course in 1st Semester) so here is a summary of some key terms: Population: The population is a set of \\(N\\) observations of interest. Population parameter: A population parameter is a numerical summary value about the population. In most settings, this is a value that's unknown and you wish you knew it. Census: An exhaustive enumeration/counting of all observations in the population in order to compute the population parameter's numerical value exactly. When \\(N\\) is small, a census is feasible. However, when \\(N\\) is large, a census can get very expensive, either in terms of time, energy, or money. Sampling: Collecting a sample of size \\(n\\) of observations from the population. Typically the sample size \\(n\\) is much smaller than the population size \\(N\\), thereby making sampling a much cheaper procedure than a census. It is important to remember that the lowercase \\(n\\) corresponds to the sample size and uppercase \\(N\\) corresponds to the population size, thus \\(n \\leq N\\). Point estimates/sample statistics: A summary statistic based on the sample of size \\(n\\) that estimates the unknown population parameter. Representative sampling: A sample is said be a representative sample if it \"looks like the population\". In other words, the sample's characteristics are a good representation of the population's characteristics. Generalizability: We say a sample is generalizable if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. Bias: In a statistical sense, we say bias occurs if certain observations in a population have a higher chance of being sampled than others. We say a sampling procedure is unbiased if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. Random sampling: We say a sampling procedure is random if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. Now that you are familiar with RMarkdown, you are encouraged to collate your work in this tutorial in a RMarkdown file. Create a .Rmd file to load the following packages into R: library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(janitor) library(moderndive) library(infer) Note: Additional information and examples can be found in Chapter 9 of An Introduction to Statistical and Data Science via R. "],["model-parameter-selection.html", "Model Parameter Selection", " Model Parameter Selection We have begun to consider the construction and use of confidence intervals (CIs) for the population parameters listed in Table 1. In particular, we used bootstrap methods to estimate the sampling distributions of the estimates in Scenarios 1-4 and used these to construct confidence intervals for the corresponding population parameters. Table 1: Scenarios of sample statisitics for inference (Table 1 repeated) Scenario Population parameter Population Notation Point estimate/sample statistic Sample Notation 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) 5 Population regression intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) Sample regression intercept \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) or \\(b_0\\) 6 Population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) Sample regression slope \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) or \\(b_1\\) Now, we will continue this process for Scenarios 5 and 6, namely construct confidence intervals for the parameters in simple and multiple linear regression models. We will start with bootstrap methods and also consider confidence intervals based on theoretical results when standard assumptions hold. We will also consider how to use confidence intervals for variable selection and finish by considering a model selection strategy based on objective measures for model comparisons. "],["confidence-intervals-for-regression-parameters.html", "Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for \\(\\beta\\) in Simple Linear Regression (SLR) Confidence Intervals for the parameters in multiple regression", " Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for \\(\\beta\\) in Simple Linear Regression (SLR) Just as we did for Scenarios 1-4 in Table 1, we can use the infer package to repeatedly sample from a dataset to estimate the sampling distribution and standard error of the estimates of the intercept (\\(\\hat \\alpha\\)) and the covariate's parameter (\\(\\hat \\beta\\)) in the simple linear regression model \\(\\hat y_i = \\hat \\alpha + \\hat \\beta x_i\\). These sampling distributions enable us to directly find bootstrap confidence intervals for the model parameters. Usually, interest lies in \\(\\beta\\) and so that will be our focus here. To illustrate this, let's return to the teaching evaluations data that we analyzed last week and start with the SLR model with age as the the single explanatory variable and the instructors' evaluation scores as the outcome variable. This data and the fitted model are shown here. slr.model &lt;- lm(score~age, data=evals) coeff &lt;- slr.model %&gt;% coef() coeff (Intercept) age 4.461932354 -0.005938225 ggplot(evals, aes(x = age, y = score)) + geom_jitter() + labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Teaching Score&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 1: SLR Model applied to Teaching Evaluation Data The point estimate of the slope parameter here is \\(\\hat \\beta=\\) -0.006. The following code estimates the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat \\beta\\) via the bootstrap method. bootstrap_beta_distn &lt;- evals %&gt;% specify(score ~ age) %&gt;% generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;% calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) bootstrap_beta_distn %&gt;% visualize() Now we can use the get_ci() function to calculate a 95% confidence interval and a 99% confidence interval. We can do this either using the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution or using an estimate of the standard error from the bootstrap distribution. Remember that both these CIs denote a range of plausible values for the unknown true population slope parameter regressing teaching score on age. percentile_beta_ci &lt;- bootstrap_beta_distn %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_beta_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.0107 -0.000972 se_beta_ci &lt;- bootstrap_beta_distn %&gt;% get_ci(level = 0.99, type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = coeff[2]) se_beta_ci # A tibble: 1 x 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.0124 0.000551 Using the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the simulated bootstrap sampling distribution the 95% confidence interval is (-0.011,-0.001). What is the 99% Confidence Interval for the age parameter by the standard effor approach? (-0.012, -0.001) (-0.012, -0.011) (-0.011, 0.001) (-0.012, 0.001) Comparing the two different confidence intervals (95% and 99%) produced by the percentile and the se methods, respectively, we conclude: The two confidence intervals are similar since the bootstrap sampling distribution was close to symmetric The two confidence intervals are quite different despite the bootstrap sampling distribution being close to symmetric The two confidence intervals are quite different because the bootstrap sampling distribution was close to symmetric The two confidence intervals are similar despite the bootstrap sampling distribution being close to symmetric Confidence Intervals for the parameters in multiple regression Let's continue with the teaching evaluations data by fitting the multiple regression with one numerical and one categorical predictor. In this model: \\(y\\): outcome variable of instructor evaluation score predictor variables \\(x_1\\): numerical explanatory/predictor variable of age \\(x_2\\): categorical explanatory/predictor variable of gender evals_multiple &lt;- evals %&gt;% select(score, gender, age) First, recall that we had two competing potential models to explain professors' teaching evaluation scores in Lab 4: Model 1: Parallel lines model (no interaction term) - both male and female professors have the same slope describing the associated effect of age on teaching score Model 2: Interaction model - allowing for male and female professors to have different slopes describing the associated effect of age on teaching score. Recall the plots we made for both these models: Figure 2: Model 1 (No interaction effect included) Figure 3: Model 2 (Interaction effect included) Let's also recall the regression models we fit. First, the regression with no interaction effect: note the use of + in the formula. par.model &lt;- lm(score ~ age + gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(par.model) Table 2: Model 1 (Regression table with no interaction effect included) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.484 0.125 35.792 0.000 4.238 4.730 age -0.009 0.003 -3.280 0.001 -0.014 -0.003 gender: male 0.191 0.052 3.632 0.000 0.087 0.294 Second, the regression with an interaction effect: note the use of * in the formula. int.model &lt;- lm(score ~ age * gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(int.model) Table 3: Model 2 (Regression table with interaction effect included) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.883 0.205 23.795 0.000 4.480 5.286 age -0.018 0.004 -3.919 0.000 -0.026 -0.009 gender: male -0.446 0.265 -1.681 0.094 -0.968 0.076 age:gendermale 0.014 0.006 2.446 0.015 0.003 0.024 Notice that, together with the estimated parameter values, the tables include other information about each estimated parameter in the model, namely: std_error: the standard error of each parameter estimate statistic: the test statistic value used to test the null hypothesis that the population parameter is zero p_value: the \\(p\\) value associated with the test statistic under the null hypothesis lower_ci and upper_ci: the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the population parameter These values are calculated using the theoretical results based on the standard assumptions that you will have seen in Regression Modelling in first semester. Theses values are not based on bootstrapping techniques since these become much harder to implement when working with multiple variables and its beyond the scope of this course. What is the 95% Confidence Interval for the difference, on average, between the (linear) effect age has on the evaluation scores of male professors and the (linear) effect age has on the evaluation scores of female professors? (0.087, 0.294) (-0.026, -0.009) (-0.968, 0.076) (0.003, 0.024) By just considering the simpler parallel lines model, what can we say about the the difference, on average, between the evaluation scores of male and female professors when age is taken into account? It's highly likely that, on average, male professors' scores are between 0.003 and 0.014 units lower than females professors' scores when age is taken into account It's highly likely that, on average, male professors' scores are between 0.003 and 0.014 units higher than females professors' scores when age is taken into account It's highly likely that, on average, male professors' scores are between 0.1 and 0.3 units lower than females professors' scores when age is taken into account It's highly likely that, on average, male professors' scores are between 0.1 and 0.3 units higher than females professors' scores when age is taken into account "],["inference-using-confidence-intervals.html", "Inference using Confidence Intervals Simple Linear Regression Multiple Regression", " Inference using Confidence Intervals Having described several ways of calculating confidence intervals for model parameters, we are now in a position to interpret them for the purposes of statistical inference. Simple Linear Regression \\(\\hat y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i\\) Whether we have obtained a confidence interval for \\(\\beta\\) in a simple linear regression model via bootstrapping or theoretical results based on assumptions, the interpretation of the interval is the same. As we have seen, A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for a population parameter. We can therefore use the confidence interval for \\(\\beta\\) to state a range of plausible values and, just as usefully, what values are not plausible. The most common values to compare the confidence interval of \\(\\beta\\) with is 0 (zero), since \\(\\beta = 0\\) says there is no (linear) relationship between the outcome variable (\\(y\\)) and the explanatory variable (\\(x\\)). Therefore, if 0 lies within the confidence interval for \\(\\beta\\) then there is insufficient evidence of a linear relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). However, if 0 does not lie within the confidence interval, then we conclude that \\(\\beta\\) is significantly different from zero and therefore that there is evidence of a linear relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Let's use the confidence interval based on theoretical results for slope parameter in the SLR model applied to the teacher evaluation scores with age as the the single explanatory variable and the instructors' evaluation scores as the outcome variable. get_regression_table(slr.model) Table 4: Estimate summaries from the SLR Model of score on age. term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.462 0.127 35.195 0.000 4.213 4.711 age -0.006 0.003 -2.311 0.021 -0.011 -0.001 Based on the fitted SLR model, is there evidence that there is a statistically significant linear relationship between the age of the professors and their teaching evaluation score? Yes No Multiple Regression Consider, again, the fitted interaction model for score with age and gender as the two explanatory variables. int.model &lt;- lm(score ~ age * gender, data = evals_multiple) get_regression_table(int.model) Table 5: Model 2 (Regression table with interaction effect included) term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.883 0.205 23.795 0.000 4.480 5.286 age -0.018 0.004 -3.919 0.000 -0.026 -0.009 gender: male -0.446 0.265 -1.681 0.094 -0.968 0.076 age:gendermale 0.014 0.006 2.446 0.015 0.003 0.024 Based on the fitted interaction model, is there evidence that we should allow for different rates of change for male and female professors' teaching scores as they get older? Yes No "],["variable-selection-using-confidence-intervals.html", "Variable selection using confidence intervals", " Variable selection using confidence intervals When there is more than one explanatory variable in a model, the parameter associated with each explanatory variable is interpreted as the change in the mean response based on a 1-unit change in the corresponding explanatory variable keeping all other variables held constant. Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting the confidence intervals of each parameter by acknowledging that each are plausible values conditional on all the other explanatory variables in the model. Because of the interdependence between the parameter estimates and the variables included in the model, choosing which variables to include in the model is a rather complex task. We will introduce some of the ideas in the simple case where we have 2 potential explanatory variables (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)) and use confidence intervals to decide which variables will be useful in predicting the outcome variable (\\(y\\)). One approach is to consider a hierarchy of models: \\[\\hat y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i}\\] \\[\\hat y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_{1i} \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\hat y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_2 x_{2i}\\] \\[\\hat y_i = \\alpha\\] Within this structure we might take a top-down approach: Fit the most general model, i.e. \\(\\hat y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i}\\) since we believe this is likely to provide a good description of the data. Construct confidence intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) If both intervals exclude 0 then retain the model with both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). If the interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) contains 0 but that for \\(\\beta_2\\) does not, fit the model with \\(x_2\\) alone. If the interval for \\(\\beta_2\\) contains 0 but that for \\(\\beta_1\\) does not, fit the model with \\(x_1\\) alone. If both intervals include 0 it may still be that a model with one variable is useful. In this case the two models with the single variables should be fitted and intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) constructed and compared with 0. If we have only a few explanatory variables, then an extension of the strategy outlined above would be effective, i.e. start with the full model and simplify by removing terms until no further terms can be removed. When the number of explanatory variables is large the problem becomes more difficult. We will consider this more challenging situation in the next section. Recall that as well as age and gender, there is also a potential explanatory variable bty_avg in the evals data, i.e. the numerical variable of the average beauty score from a panel of six students' scores between 1 and 10. We can fit the multiple regression model with the two continuous explanatory variables age and bty_avg as follows: mlr.model &lt;- lm(score ~ age + bty_avg, data = evals) Table 6: Esimate summaries from the MLR model with age and bty_avg term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 4.055 0.170 23.870 0.000 3.721 4.389 age -0.003 0.003 -1.148 0.251 -0.008 0.002 bty_avg 0.061 0.017 3.548 0.000 0.027 0.094 Following the process outlined above for choosing which variables to include in the model, what would be your next step after fitting this MLR model?

The selection of a final regression model always involves a compromise: Predictive accuracy (improved by including more predictors) Parsimony and interpretability (achieved by having less predictors) There are many objective criteria for comparing different models applied to the same data set. All of them trade off the two objectives above, i.e. fit to the data against complexity. Common examples include: The \\(R^2_{adj}\\) values, i.e. the proportions of total variation of response variable explained by the models. \\[R_{adj}^2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS/(n-p-1)}{SST/(n-1)} = 100 \\times \\Bigg[ 1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat y_i)^2/(n-p-1)}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar y_i)^2/(n-1)}\\Bigg]\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares from the fitted model \\(SST\\) is the total sum of squares around the mean response. F ratios and the F-distribution can be used to compare the \\(R_{adj}^2\\) values These can only be used for nested models, i.e. where one model is a particular case of the other Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) \\[AIC = -2(\\mbox{log-likeihood})+2p = n\\mbox{ln}\\Bigg(\\frac{RSS}{n}\\Bigg)+2p\\] A value based on the maximum likelihood function of the parameters in the fitted model penalized by the number of parameters in the model Can be used to compare any models fitted to the same response variable The smaller the AIC the 'better' the model, i.e. no distributional results are employed to assess differences Bayesian Information Criteria \\[BIC = -2(\\mbox{log-likeihood})+\\mbox{ln}(n)p\\] A popular data analysis strategy which we shall adopt is to calculate \\(R_{adj}^2\\), \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\) and prefer the models which minimize \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\) and that maximize \\(R_{adj}^2\\). To illustrate, let's return to the evals data and the MLR on the teaching evaluation score score with the two continuous explanatory variables age and bty_avg and compare this with the SLR model with just bty_avg. To access these measures for model comparisons we can use the glance() function in the broom package (not to be confused with the glimpse() function in the dplyr package). library(broom) model.comp.values.slr.age &lt;- glance(lm(score ~ age, data = evals)) model.comp.values.slr.age # A tibble: 1 x 12 r.squ~1 adj.r~2 sigma stati~3 p.value df logLik AIC BIC devia~4 df.re~5 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 0.0115 0.00931 0.541 5.34 0.0213 1 -372. 750. 762. 135. 461 # ... with 1 more variable: nobs &lt;int&gt;, and abbreviated variable names # 1: r.squared, 2: adj.r.squared, 3: statistic, 4: deviance, 5: df.residual # i Use `colnames()` to see all variable names model.comp.values.slr.bty_avg &lt;- glance(lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)) model.comp.values.slr.bty_avg # A tibble: 1 x 12 r.squ~1 adj.r~2 sigma stati~3 p.value df logLik AIC BIC devia~4 df.re~5 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 0.0350 0.0329 0.535 16.7 5.08e-5 1 -366. 738. 751. 132. 461 # ... with 1 more variable: nobs &lt;int&gt;, and abbreviated variable names # 1: r.squared, 2: adj.r.squared, 3: statistic, 4: deviance, 5: df.residual # i Use `colnames()` to see all variable names model.comp.values.mlr &lt;- glance(lm(score ~ age + bty_avg, data = evals)) model.comp.values.mlr # A tibble: 1 x 12 r.squ~1 adj.r~2 sigma stati~3 p.value df logLik AIC BIC devia~4 df.re~5 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 0.0378 0.0336 0.535 9.03 1.42e-4 2 -366. 739. 756. 131. 460 # ... with 1 more variable: nobs &lt;int&gt;, and abbreviated variable names # 1: r.squared, 2: adj.r.squared, 3: statistic, 4: deviance, 5: df.residual # i Use `colnames()` to see all variable names Note that \\(R_{adj}^2\\), \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\) are contained in columns 3, 9 and 10 respectively.

Therefore, the predictors included and the order in which they are entered into the model can have a great impact. In an ideal world, predictors should be selected based on past research and new predictors should be added to existing models based on the theoretical importance of the variables. One thing not to do is select hundreds of random predictors, bung them all into a regression analysis and hope for the best. But in practice there are automatic strategies, such as Stepwise and Best Subsets regression, based on systematically searching through the entire list of variables not in the current model to make decisions on whether each should be included. These strategies need to be handled with care, and a proper discussion of them is beyond this course. Our best strategy is a mixture of judgement on what variables should be included as potential explanatory variables, together with parameter interval estimation and a comparison of objective measures for assessing different models. The judgement should be made in the light of advice from the problem context. Golden rule for modelling The key to modelling data is to only use the objective measures as a rough guide. In the end the choice of model will involve your own judgement. You have to be able to defend why you chose a particular model.

The data contain the following variables: city - the district of LA where the house was located type - either SFR (Single Family Residences) or Condo/Twh (Condominium/Town House) bed - the number of bedrooms bath - the number of bathrooms garage - the number of car spaces in the garage sqft - the floor area of the house (in square feet) pool - Y if the house has a pool spa - TRUE if the house has a spa price - the most recent sales price ($US) We are interested in exploring the relationships betwen price and the other variables. Read the data into an object called LAhomes and answer the following questions. By looking at the univariate and bivariate distributions on the price and sqft variables below, what would be a sensible way to proceed if we wanted to model this data? What care must be taken if you were to proceed this way? Fit the simple linear model with log(price) as the response and log(sqft) as the predictor. Display the fitted model on a scatterplot of the data and construct a bootstrap confidence interval (using the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution) for the slope parameter in the model and interpret its point and interval estimates. Hint Although you can supply the lm() function with terms like log(price) when you use the infer package to generate bootstrap intervals you the transformed variable needs to already exist. Use the mutate() function in the dplyr package to create new transformed variables. Repeat the analysis in part b. but with the log of the number of bathrooms (bath) as the single explanatory variable. Fit the multiple linear regression model using the log transform of all the variables price (as the response) and both sqft and bath (as the explanatory variables). Calculate the point and interval estimates of the coefficients of the two predictors separately. Compare their point and interval estimates to those you calculated in parts b. and c. Can you account for the differences? Hint Remember that we didn't use bootstrapping to construct the confidence intervals for parameters in multiple linear regression models, but rather used the theoretical results based on assumptions. You can access these estimates using the get_regression_table() function in the moderndive package. Using the objective measures for model comparisons, which of the models in parts b., c. and d. would you favour? Is this consistent with your conclusions in part d.?
