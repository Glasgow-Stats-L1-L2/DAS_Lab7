# Introduction {-}

In this lab we construct confidence intervals for the parameters in simple and multiple linear regression models.  We consider confidence intervals based on theoretical results when standard assumptions hold.  We will also consider how to use confidence intervals for variable selection and finish by considering a model selection strategy based on objective measures for model comparisons.
